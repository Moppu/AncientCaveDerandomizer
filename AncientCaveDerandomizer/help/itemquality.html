<h3>Item Quality</h3>
Item quality is defined by a table of "desirability" values I've laid out for each item in the game.  A value of 1 indicates a less desirable item, while a value of 9 indicates a more desirable item.  A value of 0 indicates the item should never appear in chests.  These values were laid out without a whole lot of thought and are subject to change with input from users.

Setting item quality higher will result in more desirable items.  Setting it lower will result in more undesirable items.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
The current values are as follows:
