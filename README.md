# AncientCaveDerandomizer
This is a "de-randomizer" for the Ancient Cave dungeon in the SNES game Lufia 2.

Its primary function is to base Ancient Cave generation on a fixed seed, so that it's the same every time for a given ROM, allowing the same cave to be repeated or raced.

It provides a number of optional tweaks and a few quality of life changes.

There is some documentation within the tool, under the big "?" button.

This is an old project (circa 2016) that I am cleaning up a bit and publishing to GitHub, so not everything may currently be working and I don't really even remember where I left off with it, but a lot of stuff should be working.

Included is a disassembly of the vanilla Ancient Cave generation subroutine(s) and some documentation on how it works.  It is not complete.
